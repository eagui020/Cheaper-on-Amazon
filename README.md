# Cheaper-on-Amazon

The software project is a chrome extension implementation of the popular chrome extension, Cheaper on Amazon. Cheaper on Amazon is a chrome extension which allows users to compare prices of items found in the web with the price of the Amazon listed product. The Cheaper on Amazon chrome extension turns green if the product is cheaper on Amazon. We will add more features such as suggesting similar products and showing the Amazon reviews of the product they are looking at.
